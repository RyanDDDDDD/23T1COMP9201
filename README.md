 Assignment 1 involves a number of synchronisation problems within the software environment of the OS/161 kernel.

 Assignment 2 involves implementing a software bridge between a set of file-related system calls inside the OS/161 kernel and their implementation within the VFS (obviously also inside the kernel). Upon completion, the operating system will be able to run a single application at user-level and perform some basic file I/O.

 Assignment 3 involves  implementing the virtual memory sub-system of OS/161.
